# HOW TO PLAY

For each remaining day of SPIS, you can play the Castle game by updating the file `castles.json` in this repo
with your entries for that day's competition.

The file `castles.json` should contain the following when you first copy this repo. 

```json

{ "First_L" : 
  { 
    "0822' : [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
    '0823' : [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
    '0824' : [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
    '0825' : [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
    '0826' : [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
    '0827' : [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
    '0828' : [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
    '0829' : [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
    '0830' : [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
    '0831' : [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
    '0901' : [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
   }
}
```

To enter each days competition, you'll edit the numbers in the list for that day so that they represent your 10 castles.

The numbers should sum to 100, and should all be non-negative.

To check your numbers, you can run the script `check_castles.py`.
